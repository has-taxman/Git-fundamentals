# Gitflow Strategy

Gitflow is a widely adopted branching model designed to streamline feature development, release management, and bug fixes. It is particularly beneficial for teams handling large projects with frequent updates. This strategy ensures an organised workflow by assigning specific branches for different stages of development. This article outlines the implementation of Gitflow, highlighting the roles of core branches, tagging releases, and managing feature and hotfix branches.

## Core Branches in Gitflow Main Branch:

The main branch contains production-ready code. Only thoroughly tested and stable updates are merged here. Every update to main is tagged with a version number (e.g., v1.0, v1.1) to facilitate easy tracking of releases. Development Branch:

The development branch acts as the central integration point for ongoing work. It is frequently updated with new enhancements and modifications. All feature branches should originate from the development branch and be merged back once completed.

Workflow for Feature Branches Feature branches are created to develop new functionality separately from the main codebase. Hereâ€™s the standard approach in Gitflow:

## Creating a Feature Branch:

When starting a new feature, a branch is created from development, typically named feature/feature-name. Example:

```
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```
## Development and Testing:

During development, changes are committed to the feature branch. Developers can share their branch for collaboration or peer review.

## Merging Back to Development:

After completion and successful testing, the feature branch is merged back into development:

```
git checkout development
git merge feature/new-feature
git push origin development
```
Once merged, the feature branch is typically deleted to maintain repository cleanliness.

## Managing Releases 
When the development branch reaches a stable state, it is prepared for release by merging into main. This involves several steps:

## Creating a Release Branch (Optional):

For significant releases, teams may opt to create a release branch from development. This allows final testing and minor adjustments before deploying without disrupting ongoing development.

## Merging into Main and Tagging the Release:

After finalising the release, merge the release branch (or development directly) into main:

```
git checkout main
git merge development
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
git push origin main --tags
```
Tagging the release helps track deployment versions and provides an easy rollback option if required.

Handling Critical Fixes Hotfix branches are used to address urgent production issues without delaying ongoing development. The process for managing hotfixes in Gitflow is as follows:

## Creating a Hotfix Branch:

If a critical bug arises, create a hotfix branch directly from main:

```
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix
```
## Applying and Testing the Fix:

Make and test the required changes in the hotfix branch. Since it originates from main, the fix can be deployed swiftly.

## Merging Back into Main and Development:

Once verified, merge the hotfix into both main and development to maintain consistency:
```
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-fix
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix version 1.0.1"
git push origin main --tags
git checkout development
git merge hotfix/critical-fix
git push origin development
```
Tagging the fix ensures proper versioning. Deleting the hotfix branch afterwards keeps the repository organised.

## Advantages of Gitflow Implementing Gitflow provides several benefits:

Clear Structure: It maintains separation between development, testing, and production environments, preventing unverified changes from being released.
Streamlined Collaboration: Teams can develop features in parallel without interfering with each other's work.
Effective Issue Resolution: Urgent fixes can be deployed to production swiftly while ensuring all branches remain up to date.
This structured approach makes Gitflow an effective model for managing code in complex projects.
